# 01 - Kerberosating

**MITRE ATT&CK:** T1558.003 - Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Kerberoasting
  - T1018 - Remote System Discovery
**Status:** Complete
---

## Objective
Use NBTscan to find the DC and continue the attack chain. Use Impacket to get user SPNs, providing elevated access to the domain.

---

## Environment / Prerequisites
**Attacker:** Kali
**Target:** svc_sql
**Starting access:** jcyber username and password
**Lab weakening required:** Enable RC4 Encryption for Kerberos

---

## Attack Execution
1. Perform an NBTscan to find the IP address of the DC
   - ```nbtscan 10.10.10.0/24```
   - <img width="169" height="52" alt="Kali_DC" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc1809e9-1514-424f-b77e-21fa2a4035b2" />


2. Use Impacket to get a NTLM hash
   - ```impacket-GetUserSPNs lab.local/jcyber -dc-ip 10.10.10.4 -request```
   - <img width="441" height="221" alt="Kali_Kerberoast" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ddaf1d8-c4a1-4717-8475-68bf4a086e47" />
3. Use John or Hashcat like in 01-responder

---

## Explanation
- After the previous steps taken in 01-responder, we were able to gain access to the AD. Though this access has no administrator privileges, it lets us request a Kerberos ticket-granting service service ticket for the domain's SPN.
- Since some of these tickets may have RC4 encryption, they can be exploited to gain access to the service account associated with the specific SPN. This allows for privilege escalation, leaving us with administrator access to the domain.

---

## Detection Engineering
**Telementry Source:** Windows Security

```index=wineventlog EventCode=4769 Ticket_Encryption_Type=0x17```

**Rationale:** Security ID 4769 tracks the instances of successful and failed ticket requests. Encryption Type 0x17 maps to the RC4 encryption system, which is outdated and exploited in the attack we emulated.

---

## Investigation Walkthrough
Splunk:
  
  <img width="681" height="439" alt="Splunk_Kerberoast" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d66cf883-91db-4abf-a755-775a8fde4711" />
  
  - ID 4769 + Encryption_Type 0x17 matches a vulnerability associated with Kerberoasting. While nothing is inherently wrong if this is a particularly old system, it should still be noted that the AD needs to improve its encryption.
  - It would be useful to look into the requester, service account, and actual ticket to ensure that nothing malicious is happening.
  - Combined with the LLMNR alerts from 01-responder, I would be quite certain this is a malicious actor using a compromised account to try and escalate privileges in the AD.

---

## Detection Gaps / Limitations
- The Splunk alert is prone to false positives on older systems that still primarily use RC4 encryption. This will be less common on modern systems.
- Suricata gave a false positive alert for possible GoldenPac use. This is not unexpected as GoldenPac is also made by impacket. While it would mislead an investigation in the real world, it would still show that the user has been compromised and there is an active threat in the AD.

---

## Real-World Mitigation
- Disable RC4 encryption to prevent Kerberoasing
- Use strong passwords on admin accounts to prevent hash cracking

---

## Takeaways
- This attack exemplifies the importance of updating systems. If RC4 encryption was disabled, I would not have been able to do this attack at all
- While systems can be forgotten about and remain outdated, it is less likely to happen with proper security measures in place. Suricata was sending me dozens of alerts about how my Kerberos encryption measures were weak. 
- I was shocked by how nobody on the domain had to do anything for this step. Kali alone was able to escalate privileges using the automatic Kerberos ticketing.
